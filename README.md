# Amahi Platform

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/amahi/platform.png)](http://travis-ci.org/amahi/platform)

The Amahi Platform is a web-based framework that allows management of users, shares,
apps, networking and other settings in a Linux-based PC, VM or ARM-based system.

The Amahi Platform is part of the services provided by [Amahi](http://www.amahi.org).

# Contributing

Well-tested contributions are always welcome! Here's what you need to do to get the Amahi platform working:

#### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amahi/platform.git
```

#### 2. Run the tests

You can test Amahi locally with limited functionality either on the command line or in the browser and both should work. Tests are written in CoffeeScript using [QUnit](http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit#API_documentation).

To run on the command line, run the following command from the project root:

```bash
rake spec
```

#### 3. Write some test-driven code

The tests are in `spec/`. All test files are typically inside `spec/requests` and we use capybara and factory-girl for easy test writing.

#### 4. Test by hand in the browser

To run the app in the browser, you need to [bootstrap it](http://wiki.amahi.org/index.php/Amahi_Edge) first. The first db: command assumes you have MySQL up and running and will ask for the root user credentials in MySQL:

```bash
bundle install
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
rake db:seed
```

To start the app and use it with a browser, start a web server with rails:

```bash
rails s
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000/`, login with the username of `admin` & the password of `admin` and excersise the app as much as you can.


#### 5. Create a pull request

When you are ready for your changes and it's good code that fits with the goals of the project, submit a pull request and we will merge it!

#### 6. Agree to CLA

For mutual protection, please check the icla.txt file for the individual contributor agreement we require for contributors. It's a virtual copy to Apache's CLA. Generally, you will be asked by email to read it and accept. If you are working for a company or some large institution, we will ask that you submit a scan of the signed CLA for us to keep on file.
